I love coding.

I started in my teens but graduated with an MBA and worked 5 years in SEO before going back to what I love and retraining as a professional programmer. I'm currently employed as a Backend Developer and building my own projects on the side.

My goal is to become a highly competent Senior Backend Developer.
